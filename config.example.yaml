# QGIS river layer to export. Choose one of:
#   - rivers_small: Dense network that keeps tributaries for detailed local maps.
#   - rivers_medium: Balanced option (default) that trims very small streams.
#   - rivers_large: Only major rivers; useful to reduce clutter on small worlds.
#   - MajorRiversMany: Alternate dataset with more branches, derived from Natural Earth.
#   - MajorRiversFew: Same dataset but only the largest trunks.
